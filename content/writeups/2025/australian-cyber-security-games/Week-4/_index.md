title: Week 4

For this week, we needed to find the domain that the challenges were hosted on, from within the provided `.apk` 
I put this part of the challenge under the [Root Detection](Root-Detection-is-the-least-of-our-problems-but-lets-have-it-anyway/index.md) challenge as it was the only one about reversing the binary to find info, so it made the most thematic sense so be there.
