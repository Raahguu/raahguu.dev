      <description>Description These interns are going to be the end of me. How are we supposed to champion digital governance when they can&amp;rsquo;t stop leaking things?

Find out what they’ve let slip&amp;hellip; before someone less responsible does.&#xA;Alyssa Chen&#xA;Solution Flag Part 1 With the clues of Alyssa Chen, Bluesky, and Ken: it was obvious that the first step was to find their bluesky accounts.</description>

      <description>Description A certain politician has been talking a lot about transparency lately but we all know that&amp;rsquo;s just for the cameras.

      <description>Description On the surface, this signal is nothing but meaningless noise — a mere whisper of the wind. But dive deeper into this transmission, and a storm begins to take shape, with gray skies gathering on the horizon. Can you navigate through the static and uncover what lurks beneath the surface of the wav — before it’s too late?&#xA;Author: Suvoni&#xA;The challenge then gave a .wav file that was 6.</description>

      <description>Description The message lies deep beneath the surface — obscured by twisted letters, layered encryption, and ancient languages of the deep. First, it was scrambled with a twist on a classic rotation. Then, a tough key led it astray, a repeating current twisted the letters. And finally, it dove into the language of the deep - where only the most echolocative minds can decode it. But nothing stays buried forever. To retrieve the truth, you must trace its path in reverse - from the echoes back to the source.</description>

It appears routine but investigators believe crucial data is hidden within. The memo references an earlier operation involving a mid-April strategy drop, which may still be accessible. Your task, if you choose to accept it is to uncover and reconstruct the full flag, hidden across multiple layers of this document and one external source.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re Beta testing this new web application we&amp;rsquo;re going to deploy to our voters to potentially replace our mail in voting system.&#xA;Ok fine, maybe its more in the alpha stage, but we&amp;rsquo;re quite excited about this one! Feel free to give it a go with the example user.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ve implemented some logic for when a candidate wins by getting all the votes, but&amp;hellip; that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible with only one user anyways.</description>
