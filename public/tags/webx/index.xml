      <description>Description Everyone wants to be in the room where it happens! You can always wait for the invite, or just go in blind!&#xA;http://redac.ted:3000/&#xA;Solution This page is a small static page that links to a login page. We got nothing except this login page, and there is no robots.txt or sitemap.xml, so the only thing to do is to do some injection into the login field.&#xA;Now we don&amp;rsquo;t know any usernames, so we need to inject within the username field.</description>

      <description>Description Hey everyone! We&amp;rsquo;re Beta testing this new web application we&amp;rsquo;re going to deploy to our voters to potentially replace our mail in voting system.&#xA;Ok fine, maybe its more in the alpha stage, but we&amp;rsquo;re quite excited about this one! Feel free to give it a go with the example user.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ve implemented some logic for when a candidate wins by getting all the votes, but&amp;hellip; that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible with only one user anyways.</description>

      <description>Description Among the various issues that occured during the voting process, generating a vote code wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible as the system would say &amp;ldquo;Citizen &amp;lt;&amp;gt; has already voted&amp;rdquo;. It seems like someone is taking everyone elses votes! Can you find out how an attacker may have done this and submit a vote for the citizen ID CIT100 who hasn&amp;rsquo;t voted yet?&#xA;The code for the backend of all week 4 challenges was the same, so we also had that.</description>

      <description>Description While the government has provided the source code to the world, the mobile app won&amp;rsquo;t run properly because of geolocation and time restrictions! Can you identify the time and coordinates required for spoofing? Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to submit it to the relevant APIs to double check it&amp;rsquo;s correct (and get the flag).&#xA;This challenge also gave a png file, that you just need the visible text on.&#xA;The backend code for all of week 4 was the same, so we had that aswell.</description>

      <description>Description Dear Raahguu,&#xA;Can you phigure this one out?&#xA;Regards, sidd.sh&#xA;And then you also got the backend code for the website&#xA;Solution The Descrption didn&amp;rsquo;t give us much to go off, so we started off by looking through the source code. The only important part you need to know is the index.php file&#xA;&amp;lt;?php class Config { public $path = &amp;#39;information.txt&amp;#39;; public $data_folder = &amp;#39;data/&amp;#39;; } class FileLoader { public $config; // idk if we would need to load files from other directories or nested directories, but better to keep it flexible if I change my mind later public $allow_unsafe = false; // These terms will be philtered out to prevent unsafe file access public $blacklist = [&amp;#39;php&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;filter&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;flag&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>Description I found a website with some crazy privacy rules about who can join.&#xA;And a link was given&#xA;Solution The link leads to a website looking like this With a name like Request Header Manipulation, in a http/s site, it is likely that what the browser, is refering to are the request headers sent in all get requests.&#xA;So, you go to Burp and open up the website in the proxy, before moving that into the Repeater.</description>

      <description>Description Dear Raahguu,&#xA;During the email apocalypse, IT admins tried to prevent the DOS of all systems by disallowing attachments to emails. To get around this, users would create their own file storage web servers for hosting their attachments, which also got DOSed because everyone was mass spamming the links in emails&amp;hellip;&#xA;Can you read /etc/flag.txt from the filesystem?&#xA;Regards, MC Fat Monke&#xA;The challenge then also provided the source code for the email attachments file system</description>

      <description>Description I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!&#xA;The challenge is then a website, where there is a text box that you can type into, anything that you submit in the form with the text box is then shown on a new page.&#xA;Solution First glance The challenge is called SSTI, which seems like a hint, but at first, lets just try some XSS.</description>

      <description>Description Before you begin your voting, review our online guide and reach out if you have any questions. Your input is very important to us!&#xA;We were then given a link&#xA;Solution We were given a pretty basic site, just some text with one button labled Français&#xA;Clicking this button directs us from redac.ted:8001/ to redac.ted:8001/?lang=fr.php&#xA;As this is the only non static functionality of the site, this is likely where the exploit is.</description>

      <description>Description A paranormal event was observed during the voting. Apparently multiple successful vote submissions were starting to be observed in the logs for an individual and votes for citizens that don&amp;rsquo;t exist? Can you find out how an attacker may have done this and submit a vote for the citizen ID CIT1337 who has already voted?&#xA;The code for the backend of all week 4 challenges was the same, so we also had that.</description>
