      <description>Description On the surface, this signal is nothing but meaningless noise — a mere whisper of the wind. But dive deeper into this transmission, and a storm begins to take shape, with gray skies gathering on the horizon. Can you navigate through the static and uncover what lurks beneath the surface of the wav — before it’s too late?&#xA;Author: Suvoni&#xA;The challenge then gave a .wav file that was 6.</description>

      <description>Description Not every message rides the waves of sound. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to look through the noise. Let your eyes do the listening, and let the music spell it out for you. Note: You do not need to listen to the audio to do this challenge.&#xA;Writeup As always, when you download a stenography file, try checking the exif/meta data. For this I used exiftool. You can do this using a command like:</description>

      <description>Description Soldier, we believe that the enemy has hidden a spoken audio message somewhere in this file. Find it, and report back immediately.&#xA;The challange also provides an mp3 file.&#xA;Solution As always, when you download a stegonography file, try checking the exif/meta data. For this I used exiftool. You can do this using a command like:&#xA;Once you run this you get an output along the lines of:&#xA;This reveals not much, except the comment which says Is it just me or is the right channel different?</description>

      <description>Description I received this strange transmission and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to make of it! Weird beeps, static noise, then silence. Can you help me figure out what it all means?&#xA;Author: Suvoni&#xA;The challenge then also provided a .wav file.&#xA;Solution Listening to the file reveals a bunch of beeps, that sounds like morse code. I at first listened to the more code and noted it down myself, I only wrote part of it, here is what I got</description>

      <description>Description You might have heard of Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography, but have you ever heard of Third Least Significant Bit (TLSB) Steganography? (Hopefully not considering I made it up for this challenge).&#xA;Writeup The description tells you that the steganography method to hide the flag is &amp;lsquo;Third Least Significant Bit Encryption&amp;rsquo;, which with how it also mentions LSB likely means that it is just a variation on LSB encryption.</description>
